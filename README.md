# Linux Printer Installer

This shell script can be used to install network printers (intended for use in a uniersity/business/organization). I originally created it to install my school's printers on Linux, but it also works on macOS and can be adapted for other organizations who use a similar setup.

### How do I use it?

Run the file as you normally would run a shell script. Navigate to the directory containing the file and then:

`chmod +x install-printers.sh` to mark the file as executable

`./install-printers.sh` to run the script -- if this fails, try running the script as root: `sudo ./install-printers.sh`
