# Linux Printer Installer

This shell script can be used to install network printers (intended for use in a uniersity/business/organization). I originally created it to install my school's printers on Linux, but it also works on macOS and can be adapted for other organizations who use a similar setup.

### How do I use it?

This script is meant to be a starting point for network admins to develop their own installers. Running this script as-is will fail. I have provided an example script for my university.
